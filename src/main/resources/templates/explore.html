                        The highest mountain Peak of Odisha Deomali 1762 mt. high nestling
                        in the lap of the Eastern Ghats is an idealic for Aero Gliding and
                        trekking expeditions. It is 60 Kms away from Koraput. Located at a
                        distance of 65 km from Koraput town, Deomali is easily accessible
                        by road. During the last ten odd km, I stopped multiple times and
                        gazed at natureâ€™s beauty with unbridled enthusiasm and happiness.
                        As I kept climbing further and approached the last mile, the views
                        and the feeling of being in the lap of Deomali Koraput were
                        genuinely captivating and astounding. Deomali truly is OUTSTANDING
                        and BREATHTAKING. The majestic views with a range of hills spread
                        out in front of me as I gazed far into the horizon cannot be
                        explained and put into words; such is the magnificence of being in
                        the Eastern Ghats of India. Layer after layer of mountain ranges
                        presented themselves, standing together as a band of brothers and
                        DEOMALI peaking in above all as the charismatic leader.
                    <h6><b>Facts about Deomali Hill</b></h6>
                    <ol class="justify-right">
                        <li>While Odisha enjoys a mild to moderate temperature, everything changes at Deomali. The
                            temperature at Deomali is always considerably lower than the Koraput temperature or
                            Semiliguda temperature. So be prepared accordingly for Deomali Weather.</li>
                        <li>Solo travel at night to the Deomali hilltop is to be avoided.</li>
                        <li>There is a single ghat road, and it is risky at night owing to wild animals and utter
                            loneliness</li>
                        <li>There is nothing at Deomali in case of any emergency</li>
                        <li>Deomali mountain peak is in the middle of tribal land, with many tribes inhabiting the
                            mountain villages. So, one needs to be mindful of this fact.</li>
